# Math Stuff

Welcome to **Math Stuff** – a collection of my mathematics projects, exercises, and experiments. This repository covers a wide range of topics from algebra to combinatorics, with notebooks, scripts, and notes to explore.

## Structure

- **Algebra/** – Projects and exercises related to linear algebra, abstract algebra, and polynomials.
- **Calculus/** – Notes, exercises, and projects on calculus, limits, derivatives, and integrals.
- **NumberTheory/** – Exploration of prime numbers, modular arithmetic, Diophantine equations, and other number theory topics.
- **Combinatorics/** – Problems and projects on counting, permutations, combinations, and probability.
- **Geometry/** – Notes, problems, and projects on Euclidean and analytic geometry.
- **Misc/** – Miscellaneous projects, experimental ideas, and interdisciplinary math projects.

## Usage
